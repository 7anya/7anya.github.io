Hi, Welcome to my page. I am a grad student in the department of Computer Science, at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. I work in the Systopia Lab with Prof. Thomas Pasquier. Prior to this, I did my undergrad in Computer Science and Physics from BITS Pilani, India. I spent the last year of my undergrad as a visiting student at UBC too. I am interested broadly in Computer Systems and currently work in Operating systems. 

You'll find me gardening, hiking cooking or BBQ-ing in my little free time as a grad student.
